# BitStream

**DISCLAIMER: This plugin was primarily created to experiment with AI‑generated code. It is unsupported, provided as‑is, and I do not recommend using it in production.**

BitStream is an experimental WordPress plugin that adds a lightweight microblogging experience to your site. It introduces a custom post type called **Bits** which act like small status updates. Users can publish Bits, link to other content ("ReBits"), and interact via likes and comments. The project was written mostly with the help of AI tools.

## Features

- **Custom Post Type:** Registers a `bit` post type used to store short updates.
- **Automatic Titles:** Each Bit receives an autogenerated title (`Bit #YYYY-MM-DD:001`).
- **Quick Post Form:** Includes a `[bitstream_quick_post]` shortcode for a minimal form where logged‑in users can post from the front end. The form supports optional image uploads and a URL field for ReBits.
- **HEIC Image Support:** Allows HEIC and HEIF uploads. Quick Post converts them to JPEG when Imagick is available, or shows an error if not.
- **ReBits:** If a URL is provided, the plugin can display an embedded preview or link. Popular domains map to specific icons and labels (YouTube, Spotify, Goodreads, etc.).
- **Quoted Bits:** Bits can quote another Bit, showing the quoted content and date.
- **Likes and Comments:** AJAX handlers allow visitors to like/unlike posts and load additional Bits without reloading the page. Comments are enabled by default.
- **Infinite Scroll & Load More:** The `[bitstream]` shortcode outputs a feed of Bits that supports infinite scroll. A separate `[bitstream_latest]` shortcode renders only the most recent Bit.
- **PWA Support:** When using the quick post page, the plugin loads a manifest and simple service worker so the form can work as a minimal Progressive Web App.
- **Styling and Scripts:** Includes accompanying CSS (`bitstream.css`) and JavaScript (`bitstream.js`) for layout, likes, comment toggling, copy‑link, infinite scroll, and front‑end tweaks.

## Usage

1. Upload the plugin files to your WordPress `plugins` directory and activate it.
2. Create a page and insert the `[bitstream]` shortcode to display the Bit feed. You can also add the `[bitstream_quick_post]` shortcode on a dedicated page for posting.
3. Visit `/bitstream/` on your site to see published Bits.
4. To upload HEIC images, you must have the Imagick PHP extension installed on your server.
Because this project was created primarily for experimentation, the code may be incomplete or unstable. Use at your own risk.
